# Getting & Cleaning Data
Course Project for Getting &amp; Cleaning Data

The R script, `run_analysis.R` has been uploaded and it performs the mentioned operations:

1. Downloading the dataset if it does not already exist.
2. Reading the dataset.
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
8. The tidy dataset is saved as the file `tidy_dataset.txt`.
